Ever feel like you don't know ball? Stuck in constant Twitter debates pushing baseless slander and agendas? Getting your footy knowledge off of TikTok edits?

Never fear. I am beginning to come up with a solution for how comparisons between soccer players are handled. 

The problem with online soccer debates nowadays is that players are compared to each other completely based on their positions, while paying no regard to what those players actually do on the field.
Take Pedri and Jude Bellingham, two players who are continuously compared to each other. The similarities between them seem obvious enough: they're both midfielders playing for the two biggest clubs in Spain. However, if you look at their actual roles on the field, these two players couldn't be more different. Pedri is someone who excels at controlling a game, sitting back and dictating the tempo at which his team plays at. Bellingham, on the other hand, is an elite box to box midfielder known for making late runs into the box and his excellent positioning. So when you compare these two players, how can you even decide who's better if they don't even do the same thing on the field?

I wrote this machine learning model in order to start comparing players that play the same role on the field. The first step of that is to accurately classify player's roles and playstyles into archetypes. I've decided to follow a Briggs-Myers personality model to depict this. If you're unfamiliar with Briggs-Myers, it's the same concept that governs the 16 Personalities quiz. 

Each player will be given a category based on 4 predetermined dimensions. The dimensions and their classifications are:


Mentality: Scorer (S) vs. Facilitator (F)

Work Ethic: Warrior (W) vs. Specialist (P)

Presence: Involved (I) vs. Clinical (C)

Temperament: Intense (N) vs. Composed (O)


The hope of this model is to be able to change how soccer fans as a whole perceive and think about the sport. As the model improves, we can learn more about how players can be compared to each other.
